I completed high school in Brussels, Belgium, before pursuing a engineering master’s degree in Lille, France, graduating early (age of 21) and ranking 1st out of 196 students.
I am currently enrolled in a PhD programme at the CEA (French Atomic Energy Commission), affiliated with Université Paris‑Saclay.
My research interests focus on optimisation methods, metaheuristics, and applied artificial intelligence (particularly representation learning).
