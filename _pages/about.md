*PhD Student in Nuclear Physics and Artificial Intelligence*

I completed high school in Brussels, Belgium, before pursuing an engineering degree (computer science & big data) in Lille, France, graduating early (at the age of 21) as valedictorian. 
I am currently enrolled in a PhD programme at the CEA (French Atomic Energy Commission), affiliated with Université Paris-Saclay.

My research interests mainly focus on optimisation methods, metaheuristics, and applied artificial intelligence (particularly representation learning).
